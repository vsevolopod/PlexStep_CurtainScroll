PlexStep_CurtainScroll
Written by Vsev Krawczeniuk

This is an arduino program for the PlexStep DMX Stepper motor drivers.
They control two stepper motors using TMC2209 stepper drivers.
The microcontroller used is an Atmega 32u4, currently we are treating the PlexStep boards as if they are an Arduino Leonardo.


Pin Assignments:
Driver 1 Enable: D10
Driver 1 Step: D6
Driver 1 DIR: D4
Driver 1 DIAG: D2
Driver 1 UART RX: D9
Driver 1 UART TX: D8
Driver 1 CLK: D12

Driver 2 Enable: D11
Driver 2 Step: D13
Driver 2 DIR: D5
Driver 2 DIAG: D3
Driver 2 UART RX: D9
Driver 2 UART TX: D8
Driver 2 CLK: A0

Steppers are handled by the AccelStepper library
Currently in .pio/build/leonardo/lib8d5

Pins A1-A5 are broken out to phoenix connectors.
Currently they are assigned as:
A2: Motor 1 homing hall effect sensor
A3: Motor 2 homing hall effect sensor

Reserved for future use:
A1
A4
A5
D2: Interrupt pin for E-Stop

Currently only DMX In works. The DE and RE pins are tied to ground with a bodge wire to enable input only. Future versions of the board connect this pin to A1 and allow for RDM compatability. 
DMX is handled by the DMXSerial library by mathertel
Currewntly in .pio/build/leonardo/libb70

This program was originally created in Arduino IDE and converted to Platform IO.
